# Nodejs / Express / MongoDB / Mongoose Bootcamp. from: Jonas.io

I will be regularly updating this repo following up the Jonas Schmedtmann course.

A v1.0 realse is up. Completing all the sections of the course that involved developing the REST API. I will keep updating this API with features I deem necessary or that I think will be fun to implement.

Current topics covered in the course:

-   Nodejs Fundamentals
-   Async JS.
-   REST API Design.
-   CRUD Operations on REST API
-   Authentication
-   Authorization
-   Error Handling
-   Nested Routing
-   Query Middleware
-   Agreggation Middleware
-   Metrics with the aggregation pipeline
-   Document embedding
-   Geospacial queries.
-   Virtual fields in the schema.
-   JWT
-   Sending emails with Nodemailer
-   Usage of Node Middleware like: morgan, helmet, rateLimit
